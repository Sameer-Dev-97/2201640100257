URL Shortener Web Application
This project is a user-friendly URL shortener built with React that not only shortens URLs but also provides detailed analytical insights into the clicks on each shortened link.

üåü Features
URL Shortener Page
Create Short Links: Shorten up to 5 URLs at once.

Customization: Provide an optional custom shortcode and set an expiration period (in minutes). If no expiration is provided, the link defaults to a 30-minute validity.

Client-Side Validation: Ensures that all input fields (URL format, shortcode, validity) are validated before making a request to the server.

Instant Display: Upon creation, the shortened URLs are displayed with their respective creation and expiry dates.

URL Shortener Statistics Page
Detailed Analytics: View a list of all shortened URLs created in the current session.

Click Data: For each short link, you can see:

The total number of times the link has been clicked.

Detailed click timestamps.

The geographical source of each click.

The location (country/city) from which the click originated.

General Functionality
Unique Shortcodes: The application ensures that all generated shortcodes are unique.

Redirection: Clicking on a shortened URL automatically redirects to the original long URL.

Error Handling: Robust client-side error handling provides clear, user-friendly messages for invalid inputs or other operational issues.
